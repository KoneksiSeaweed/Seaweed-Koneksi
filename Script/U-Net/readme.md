Inside this folder, there are several scripts that we use to train the model. First, augmentation to improve the dataset. Then, we train the dataset with the U-Net architecture using the 'mapping' code. After the model training results produce the best performing model, we perform model inference by predicting it to new data with the 'looping mapping' code to produce seaweed cultivation area segmentation.
